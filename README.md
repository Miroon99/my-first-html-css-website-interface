# my-first-html-css-website-interface
My first website using html and css only, assignment given by our lecturer in web development course.
This is just a website plainly written by html and css, no back-end, just the interface tasked by our lecturer to see our understanding in html. But it's ugly right with only html ? so i added css to make up the little girl
